= IntelliJ IDEA plugin sample

A simple IntelliJ IDEA plugin inspired by https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-essentials/en/10-create-an-extension.html.

The plugin adds a `Search on StackOverflow` action to editor and console windows.
If text is selected in the window, then the selected text will be used as the search query, along with the language detected by IDEA.
If no text is selected, then a dialog will be displayed to allow the search query to be entered.
